# Hotel data merge - solution

## Introduction

This is an attempt to [this coding challenge](https://kitt.lewagon.com/db/123650).

## Setup

### Programming languages

- Python (Flask)
  reasoning: the most efficient language to perform the data cleanup process. The Flask server will provide a single API endpoint that returns the cleaned API response based on the multiple supplier API
- Ruby on Rails
  reasoning: to match the stack used in Ascenda and also the fastest to setup for a simple API endpoint provider

### Approaches

#### V0 (Server setup and initial data cleanup)

- Please see [this repo](https://github.com/primaulia/hotel-cleanup-api) for the procuring process
- Setup class diagram based on the API response example
